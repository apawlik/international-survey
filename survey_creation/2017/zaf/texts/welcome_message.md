**The purpose of this survey is to collect information about people who develop software that is used in research. We call these people *[Research Software Engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers)* [(RSEs)](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers), but they use many different job titles (including postdoctoral researcher and research assistant).**

Why did I receive this invitation?
----------------------------------

You have received this link because you are a member of the UK RSE Association or you were identified as someone working in an RSE role.
The [North-West University](http://www.nwu.ac.za/) eResearch Initiative have informally been collaborating with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk)(SSI) and various RSE leaders in the UK since 2015. The community of RSEs and specifically the SSI have loads of [resources for research software developers](https://www.software.ac.uk/resources) and we hope that by running this survey, we would be able to create a broader awareness of the communities and resources that exist and help to establish a local RSE community.
There is currently little reliable information about the global RSE community, so the SSI have been asked to collect this information to help funders and other research organisations develop policies that will support RSEs.
This questionnaire gives you the opportunity to express your views about your current job and give us information about your career path.

Please note that this research is not compulsory and even if you decide to participate you can withdraw at any moment.

How long will it take?
----------------------

There is a maximum of 64 questions in this survey. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
