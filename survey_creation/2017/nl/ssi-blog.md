We would like to invite everyone working on research software in the Netherlands to complete
the survey and spread the word:

[Research Software Engineer (RSE) community in the Netherlands 
(NL-RSE)](http://nl-rse.org) was started to gain insight into the various communities 
of RSEs in the Netherlands and increase the interaction between them. The RSE surveys 
in the UK in 2016 and 2017 [1, 2] have allowed to gain valuable insights and spread the 
word about the RSE movement.

That is why the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), 
[ePLAN](https://escience-platform.nl/) (Platform of eScience/Data Research Centers in 
the Netherlands), [NL-RSE](http://nl-rse.org/), and the [UK RSE 
Association](http://rse.ac.uk/) are organizing this survey for 2017 in the Netherlands.

The study is conducted by the University of Southampton on behalf of the [Software 
Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/) and complies with University of 
Southampton ethics guidelines (reference no.: ERGO/FPSE/25269). The investigators are 
[Simon Hettrick](mailto:s.hettrick@software.ac.uk) and [Olivier 
Philippe](mailto:olivier.philippe@soton.ac.uk). Contact persons in the Netherlands are 
[Ben van Werkhoven](mailto:b.vanwerkhoven@esciencecenter.nl) and [Tom 
Bakker](mailto:t.bakker@esciencecenter.nl) from the Netherlands eScience Center.
